🩸 Effect of Physiological Parameters on PPG-Signal–Based Glucose Estimation

This project investigates how physiological parameters—such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation—affect the performance of PPG-signal–based blood glucose estimation models.
The goal is to understand which features contribute most to accurate glucose prediction and how variations in physiological conditions influence model reliability.

🔬 Method Overview

The code implements a full experimental pipeline for:

✔ 1. PPG Signal Preprocessing

Noise removal

Smoothing and normalization

Extraction of clean PPG waveforms

Calculation of time-domain and frequency-domain features

✔ 2. Feature Engineering

Physiological parameters extracted or used include:

Heart rate

SpO₂

Blood pressure

PPG morphological features

Derivative features (PPG-first derivative, PPG-second derivative)

These features are integrated with glucose labels for model training.

✔ 3. Machine Learning Pipeline

The project evaluates several regression models for glucose estimation, including:

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost

Linear Regression

Support Vector Regression

The models are trained and evaluated on combined PPG + physiological feature sets to assess their effect on accuracy.

✔ 4. Performance Evaluation

The code computes:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

R² score

Scatter plots & prediction–vs–ground-truth curves

These metrics are compared across different feature combinations to determine the influence of physiological parameters on glucose estimation performance.
